## About app versions
- TicWatch Pro 3/5 devices are upgraded to Wear OS 3.5, which is based on Android 11 (API level `30`).
- Wear OS 4.0 = Android 13 (API level `33`)
  - For Galaxy Watch users, you can download apks targeting Android 13 (API level `33`) or Android 11 (API level `30`) since they're on Wear OS 4.0.
- Wear OS 3.5 = Android 11 (API level `30`)
  - For TWP3/5 users only, download the latest Android 11 version only (API level `30`). Android 13 (API level `33`) will not work.
- Only `arm-v7a` / `armeabi-v7a` apk versions work, do not use `arm64-v8a`.

## Apps I recommend
### Alexa for Wear OS

## May no longer be supported
These apps worked in the past, but may no longer work.

### Messenger Lite
Some folks recommend Facebook or Messenger (not lite), since Facebook may have deprecated all their lite apps or their lite apps are obfuscated due to screen density issues.
- com.facebook.mlite_338.0.0.3.102-436638495_minAPI13(armeabi-v7a)(120,160dpi)_apkmirror.com.apk

### Messenger Notifications
Only shows notifications. This isn't so necessary since you can just use the built-in Wear OS notifications.
- com.facebook.orca_121.0.0.13.70-60338733_minAPI24(nodpi)_apkmirror.com.apk
