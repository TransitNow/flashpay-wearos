## TODO
- Let users choose their own apps (<queries> permission may conflict here)
    - Inform users what apps they need to download, prompt them to download
- Render error screen (make the app not transparent), catch errors (e.g. if flashlight app is not installed)
- Address theme (find out if it's affecting the theme or if FrameLayout transparent was sufficient)
- Video tutorial
- Launch to Play store beta/alpha testing
